I like reading these optimistic books. They get me fired up about the world and all the opportunities that exist out there.

Some of my favorites snippets and ideas:
<br>

Monopoly, when you create and deliver something no other business does.

Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist.

Proprietary tech must be at least ten times better then its substitute to lead to a real advantage.

Small minorities often achieve disproportionate results.

Life is not a portfolio.  Individuals cannot diversify their own life by keeping dozens of careers in reserve. 

Schools do it wrong.  homogenized generic knowledge.

It does matter what you do.  You should focus relentlessly on something your good at doing.

Will it be valuable in the future?

We live in a power law world.

Something hard to do but doable.

The actual truth is there are many more secrets left to find but they will yield only to the relentless searching.

Two kinds of secrets, secrets of nature and secrets about people.
