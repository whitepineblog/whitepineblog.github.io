Wow, what a life. He changed how we understand the world.  And it wasn't just one paper. He produced new ideas repeatedly.  How did he do it?

The author said he started asking the question at 16, what it would look like if you were traveling on a beam of light. Everyone knows he created the theory of relativity but he did much more to.

Look at his wikipedia page and the list under the scientific career. It is long and exciting.  Not only did he produce great work at the beginning of his career but he continued to contribute.

I love reading a book and seeing how it is that a human being can discover or create something that didn't exist.

The ability to view the world, to wonder, to ask questions and then to answer those questions in a way that changes how others view the world. That is powerful and amazing.

He had to put in the work and the effort.  And it paid off.

Einstein was disgusted with the militarism of Germany and despised the Nazi's.  He gave up his pacifism to urge fighting them.

I found it interesting that he admired Spinoza.  

He seemed like a man who loved life and lived it well.
