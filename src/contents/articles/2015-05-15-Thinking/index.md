The book was interesting, some parts more then others.

Some ideas I found interesting:

100 Billion neurons with 1000 connections each, creates possible combinations that number more then the particles in the universe.

What if neurons have maintained some of the pre multi-cellular independence so that they are cells that work according to their own rules.

Is consciousness really something deeper or is it simply a response to all of our inputs.
