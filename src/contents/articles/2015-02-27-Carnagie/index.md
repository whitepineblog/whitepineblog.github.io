His father was a weaver which was deprecated by manufactured goods. His mom worked to make ends meet and eventually they moved to America.

His first job was as a messenger boy and then a telegraph operator. He was particularly good at deciphering or guessing words that didn't come completely through.

His first opportunity to buy a stock that gave dividends was well remembered.  When the first dividend check came he was quite impressed with that way of earning money.

Buying, selling, merging, and creating companies his years of creating a fortune went by quickly. He emphasized the importance of becoming a specialist in one area to become an expert. A man has only so much time in his life, so if you can understand one are well then you can make a difference in that area. 

Then he began giving his money away. He created foundations, libraries, trusts.  He ended up giving away 90% of his money before he died.

He tried to prevent world war 1 and was deeply troubled that it hadn't been prevented.

He ended up being one of the richest men in the history of the world. And he set a great example of what to do with that wealth.
