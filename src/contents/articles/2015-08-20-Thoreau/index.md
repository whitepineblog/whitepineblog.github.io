Thoreau 

<span class="more"></span>

The city of Concord must have been quite the place. Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau and other impressive American authors.

Henry went to Harvard. Came back home, went to the city for a short time and then came back. Henry and his brother started a school that lasted for a while.

They built a boat and floated down the river. His brother died a tragic death from a small cut and then developed lock jaw.

Henry accidentally burnt down a large section of forest. 

He was mentored by Emerson, chose the place for his hut by Walden pond.  His essay on Civil Disobedience inspired MLK, Gandhi and countless others.

A short life but still one of my favorite authors.
