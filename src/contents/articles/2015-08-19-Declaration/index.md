Own it and understand that this document belongs to each of us.

2 groups of people taught. Night classes, day classes each had insights to share and a different perspective.

Slow reading allows for a greater depth of understanding of this amazing document.  It isn't just a political statement. The Declaration is a philosophical one. And declares self evident truths.

All men are created equal.  We have certain unalienable rights and government is there to secure these rights.

Understanding the history around these words, where these people came from and how the declaration was created helps us to understand the document itself. 

The declaration was a document created by committee. Jefferson originally had a paragraph against the slave trade that removed. Emphasis was changed and added with each revision.
