I discovered a fantastic book a few weeks ago.  I was browsing the library in the topic of history and found Will Durants, Story of Philosophy.  I thought it might be boring but I would give it a try. 

I am glad I did.  The book as been entertaing, educating and a great glimpse into the minds of some interesting humans. I was suprised to find out after I had listend to half of it that it was published in the year 1926.
