Re-examining what the America's were like before contact with the old world.

<span class="more"></span>

The Clovis culture 13,000 years ago, evidence of even older habitation in south America.

The Homburg mistake: taking a remnant of survivors as representative of the culture.  

Devastation caused by the loss of maybe 90% of the population. Reports of numerous towns and large populations and then 50 years later a depopulated place.

A landscape that was a giant farm, trees, grasslands maintained by the natives with fire and plantings.

The Aztec and Inca conquest. Tenochtitlan was bigger then Paris when it was conquered and had sewer systems and was quite the city.

The Mayan cities and their battles for supremacy. The Hopewell culture.  

What philosophies and ideas were destroyed when their cultures and traditions were destroyed? No one can read the Inca knot writing. Most of the books were burned by the Spanish.

The crops of the world were changed by what the American's had domesticated.
