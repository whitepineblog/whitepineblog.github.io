Get a timer, find a place to sit, straighten your back, close your eyes, breathe in an out, focus on the moment and let your meditation begin.

You can sit back and watch your concsious stream of thought flow. Kindly remind it to come back to the present moment. Watching and focusing on where you feel your breath coming in and out can help. The point where you feel it is referred to the anchor point. Come back to it as often as you need.

The first week he recommends you focus on your breath.  

The second week focus on the sounds around you, just listening to them rise and fall.

The third week pay attention to your body.  A part or place on it may 'light up'. Sit back and observe.

4th, label thoughts past, future, allow them to dance away and surrender into the silent vast presence.

5th, Graciously decline those thoughts that appear during the meditation then focus on the breath.

6th, watch your inner projection screen and observe the images that come and go.

7th, focus on acts of kindness you performed and remember how you felt.

8th, the combination technique, watch and label what arises in your consciousness.

The book was simple and straight forward.  I am excited to try out the meditation and see if it really makes a difference in my life.
