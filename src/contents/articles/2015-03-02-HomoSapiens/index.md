The species that has come to dominate planet earth.

<span class="more"></span>

There used to be multiple species of humans on the planet.  Neanderthals died out 50,000 years ago and several other species co existed with Homo Sapien Sapiens.  Homo Ergastor had survived for around 2 million years.  Quite a feat in the history of species.

Around 100,000 years ago the modern human came on the scene. Out of Africa and across the planet. Wherever he went massive changes were wrought.  Australia, the large flightless birds and giant marsupials went extinct.  When they made it to North and South America 50 of the 60 large mammal species went extinct as well.

The agricultural revolution was certainly a step backwards for most individuals, more hours of work, less diversified food sources, malnutrition and a lower quality of life. It didn't happen all at once but over time the hunter gatherers created permanent settlements and turned to the plow.

Humans have the ability to imagine, to create a myth and believe in its reality. The idea of gods, states and corporations.  Things that only exist in the realm of the mind. People will sacrifice their lives for an idea, they will spend their lives working for an idea.

What Will the future hold for humanity. Will the singularity happen?  Will we create a new species of humans with genetic engineering? Humans have changed the planet more then any other species before them. The possibilities for what they create in the future are endless.
