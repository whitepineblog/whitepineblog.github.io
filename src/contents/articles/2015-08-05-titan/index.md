A devout baptist who loved his wife and family dearly. He worked hard and created an empire of wealth. 

His Father was constantly traveling and selling cancer cures while having another family in another city.

His mother taught him to work hard and to be a good puritan Christian. He was good at numbers and became a good book keeper then a partner in a commodities firm and then began dealing in Oil to produce kerosene.

He focused on creating refineries in Clevelend, bought out his partners and eventually created the corporation Standard Oil with an initial 10,000 shares.

The oil boom was in Pennsylvania but the prices had wild fluctuations. John had the long term in view and was able to secure lower shipping rates from the railroads by promising consistent shipments.

He was very involved with his church, delivering sermons, helping clean, attending the social events and teaching his children to be good Christians. A very devout man who was devoted to his wife and children.  

He died in 1937 at the age of 98. The world changed while he was alive and he was a powerful force in its change. His legacy and charities are still a powerful force today.
