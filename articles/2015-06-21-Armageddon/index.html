<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_World_War_I">Wikipedia</a> has a useful time line of the events and how the alliances pulled one country in and another then another until Russia, Britain, France and eventually America were fighting Germany, Austria-Hungary and the&nbsp;Ottomans.</p>
<p>It was a time period that bridges the old world with the new. Calvary charges against machine guns. Men charging in ordered lines and then mowed down and&nbsp;killed.</p>
<p>Defensive positions had a decisive advantage. But it took the generals time to realize what did and didn’t work with the new technologies. The time cost millions of lives and created a living hell for the soldiers. The number of losses were multiples more then previous&nbsp;wars.</p>
<p>The Germans decided on open submarine warfare, which was disastrous for Britain until they discovered the idea of traveling in&nbsp;convoys.</p>
<p>Russian experienced it’s revolution and the old government collapsed resulting in a treaty freeing up the German eastern front. The Germans decided on a last ditch offense, but the Allies were able to drive back the Germans forcing a&nbsp;surrender.</p>
<p>The pointless battles and the pointless loss of human life. It was such a huge waste and in retrospect it accomplished little besides setting up the stage for world war&nbsp;2.</p>
