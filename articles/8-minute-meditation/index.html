          <section class="content"><p>Gain a sharper focus, more patience and more appreciation for this moment in your life through the practice of Meditation. Learning to mediate isn’t&nbsp;hard.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Get a timer, find a place to sit, straighten your back, close your eyes, breathe in an out, focus on the moment and let your meditation&nbsp;begin.</p>
<p>You can sit back and watch your conscious stream of thought flow. Kindly remind it to come back to the present moment. Watching and focusing on where you feel your breath coming in and out can help. The point where you feel it is referred to the anchor point. Come back to it as often as you&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>The first week he recommends you focus on your&nbsp;breath.  </p>
<p>The second week focus on the sounds around you, just listening to them rise and&nbsp;fall.</p>
<p>The third week pay attention to your body.  A part or place on it may ‘light up’. Sit back and&nbsp;observe.</p>
<p>4<span class="ord">th</span>, label thoughts past, future, allow them to dance away and surrender into the silent vast&nbsp;presence.</p>
<p>5<span class="ord">th</span>, Graciously decline those thoughts that appear during the meditation then focus on the&nbsp;breath.</p>
<p>6<span class="ord">th</span>, watch your inner projection screen and observe the images that come and&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>7<span class="ord">th</span>, focus on acts of kindness you performed and remember how you&nbsp;felt.</p>
<p>8<span class="ord">th</span>, the combination technique, watch and label what arises in your&nbsp;consciousness.</p>
<p>The book was simple and straight forward.  I am excited to try out the meditation and see if it really makes a difference in my&nbsp;life.</p>
