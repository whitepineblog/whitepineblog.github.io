          <section class="content"><p>The answer is use Math. But careful simple algebra doesn’t model the real world close enough or maybe your algebra is&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Linear extrapolations of non linear graphs, probability, how/when to play a lottery, scatter plots, understanding what the numbers really mean.  Paying attention to the&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>Trends are not always linear. In fact they usually aren’t.  Sometimes they will level off at some point.  So in 2050 110% of Americans wont be&nbsp;fat!</p>
<p>We have a problem with studies.  Are the results really significant?  Often times not really.  Oh and don’t play the lottery, unless it is calculated to give you a good return, which a Massachusetts lottery did for a while until it&nbsp;stopped.</p>
<p>The book was light heartedly serious and fun to read. Proposals for new ways to use votes to select the winner. I learned about David Hilbert’s 23 questions for mathematics and lots of other cool&nbsp;ideas.</p>
<p>One can create their own math or geometries that sometimes actually turn out to be quite&nbsp;useful.</p>
