<p>The stories from ancient Greece, Rome and of others captured the reality of life in the era.  These people had their hopes and dreams, then lived and died.  Some accomplished a lot, it was amazing to see what some of these people had accomplished in their&nbsp;lives.</p>
<p>Pericles who held power for more then 30 years and created a marvelous peace.  It was interesting to read his wife Aspasia was a prostitute.  And then the rise of philosophy. These long dead people are still influencing thought in our world&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Rome sure had interesting time of it. Good rulers and bad, from republic to&nbsp;empire.</p>
<p>Reading of Raphael and Michelangelo and there creations. Leonardo Da Vinci the epitome of the&nbsp;Renaissance. </p>
<p>The reformation was quite the event.  Individuals are powerful and can change the course of history in unexpected ways. I wonder what the short history of civilization will focus on 5,000 years from now. What sort of mention will my era&nbsp;get?</p>
