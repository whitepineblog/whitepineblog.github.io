          <section class="content"><p>Socrates, “Now it is time that we were going, I to die and you to live, but which of us has the happier prospect is unknown to anyone but&nbsp;God.”</p>
<p>The speeches begin with Socrates and our short excerpts but I certainly enjoyed stepping back in time to listen to Edmund Burke, Patrick Henry, Abraham Lincoln and&nbsp;others.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Demosthenes was angry and at the man who supported the conqueror of Greece, Cicero was angry and the man who he felt was betraying Rome, William of Normandy was mad at King&nbsp;Harold.</p>
<p>Lots of made people it was an interesting listen though.  I enjoyed Edmund Burke speaking out for American rights and what would happen if they were ignored.  I wonder if Britain had acted more responsibly what would America be&nbsp;today?</p>
<p>It was nice to be exposed to the speech against slavery and the speech from the French Revolution, then ending with the call for womens&nbsp;suffrage.</p>
<p>Styles of speech have changed but the speech of one person, the sharing of their ideas and passions continues to have an effect on people.  I wonder today that the art of speeches and their effect has lessened. I spend more time reading, less time listening to or reading the speeches of the leaders of&nbsp;today.</p>
