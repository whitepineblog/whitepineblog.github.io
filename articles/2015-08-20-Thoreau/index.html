<p>The city of Concord must have been quite the place. Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau and other impressive American&nbsp;authors.</p>
<p>Henry went to Harvard. Came back home, went to the city for a short time and then came back. Henry and his brother started a school that lasted for a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>They built a boat and floated down the river. His brother died a tragic death from a small cut and then developed lock&nbsp;jaw.</p>
<p>Henry accidentally burnt down a large section of&nbsp;forest. </p>
<p>He was mentored by Emerson, chose the place for his hut by Walden pond.  His essay on Civil Disobedience inspired <span class="caps">MLK</span>, Gandhi and countless&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>A short life but still one of my favorite&nbsp;authors.</p>
