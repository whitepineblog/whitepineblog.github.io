<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>The Clovis culture 13,000 years ago, evidence of even older habitation in south&nbsp;America.</p>
<p>The Homburg mistake: taking a remnant of survivors as representative of the&nbsp;culture.  </p>
<p>Devastation caused by the loss of maybe 90% of the population. Reports of numerous towns and large populations and then 50 years later a depopulated&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>A landscape that was a giant farm, trees, grasslands maintained by the natives with fire and&nbsp;plantings.</p>
<p>The Aztec and Inca conquest. Tenochtitlan was bigger then Paris when it was conquered and had sewer systems and was quite the&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>The Mayan cities and their battles for supremacy. The Hopewell&nbsp;culture.  </p>
<p>What philosophies and ideas were destroyed when their cultures and traditions were destroyed? No one can read the Inca knot writing. Most of the books were burned by the&nbsp;Spanish.</p>
<p>The crops of the world were changed by what the American’s had&nbsp;domesticated.</p>
