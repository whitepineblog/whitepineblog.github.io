<p>When dreaming your mind can be fooled to thinking you are awake and any absurd or strange thing you experience feels real to your mind. Even if it doesn’t make&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>Descartes if famous for saying I think therefore I am. For his philosophy he wanted to establish what you can really trust.  Can you trust your senses?  He says no.  Take for example dreaming.  When in a dream you often think it is real and your senses say to your mind it is.  Likewise when awake your senses can be&nbsp;deceived.  </p>
<p>Reason or mine own thoughts can be examined.  If there is something incorrect in them eventually I can find the inconsistencies or the paradoxes.  From the establishment of reason and the ability to think as a base Descartes goes on to say that God must exist because a creator or a first thinker is&nbsp;required.</p>
<p>He was quite the individual, very prolific in his life.  Creating, researching, thinking&nbsp;questioning.</p>
