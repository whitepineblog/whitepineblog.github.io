<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>I must say I love this book.  So many great&nbsp;ideas. </p>
<p>Humans and other creatures react to the world without having to understand how everything works.  You don’t have to understand the underlying theories of electro magnetism to use a computer, or the standard model in physics to get through your life&nbsp;successfully.</p>
<p>Worms can burrow through the ground without apparently any understanding for the physical laws they are subject&nbsp;to. </p>
<p>Learning is done by concrete mechanisms that can be understood by the methods of computer&nbsp;science.</p>
<p>Ecorithims are algorithms that derive their power from learning from whatever environment they&nbsp;inhabit.</p>
<p>Ecorithims can be designed using conjunction and de-junctions (simple identifying statements that are stackable) you can identify and classify things as being positive or negative for the simulated organism.  Or you can identify and classify things as plants are animals depending on a rule set.  You have to have some examples to start with.  Hopefully these examples are randomly chosen then you need to establish your rules and then you need to be able to correct your rules when you find them being&nbsp;incorrect.</p>
<p>Humans have the code to generate 20,000 different proteins, then we have regulatory genes that control when those proteins are encoded and how often. Then there are environmental factors and epigenetics.  Lots of&nbsp;variables. </p>
<p>Then there is the need for reasoning on top of&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>We don’t have the perfect algorithm yet, but we are getting&nbsp;closer.</p>
<p>Come back for part 2 when I take a closer look at some of the&nbsp;algorithms.</p>
