          <section class="content"><p>Alan Turing, the mathematician who thought of the universal machine.  One that could be made and programmed to do a variety of tasks and then one day even be able to&nbsp;think.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>His machine was never built.  He did get money to start building it.  It was called the <span class="caps">ACE</span> machine but became so modified from his original design it wasn’t his design anymore when it finally came&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>I came away from this book impressed with the skills, thoughts and original ideas it took to create the modern world that I enjoy&nbsp;today. </p>
<p>The rules he setup for his machine allowed the application of mathematics and the language of logic to program the machine to perform whatever task the programmer&nbsp;desired.</p>
<p>He proposed that eventually a machine would be able to think.  And created what came to be known as the Turing test to identify a thinking machine.  Basically if you were chatting with a machine and couldn’t tell the difference between the machine and a real human then the machine will have passed the Turing&nbsp;test.</p>
<p>The tragedy of the story is how he was persecuted by the state for his homosexuality, forced to take hormone altering drugs and it likely lead to his&nbsp;suicide.  </p>
