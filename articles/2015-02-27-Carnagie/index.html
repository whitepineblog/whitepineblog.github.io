          <section class="content"><p>Andrew Carnegie, a poor Irish kid who set the pattern for modern&nbsp;philanthropy.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>His father was a weaver which was deprecated by manufactured goods. His mom worked to make ends meet and eventually they moved to&nbsp;America.</p>
<p>His first job was as a messenger boy and then a telegraph operator. He was particularly good at deciphering or guessing words that didn’t come completely&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>His first opportunity to buy a stock that gave dividends was well remembered.  When the first dividend check came he was quite impressed with that way of earning&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>Buying, selling, merging, and creating companies his years of creating a fortune went by quickly. He emphasized the importance of becoming a specialist in one area to become an expert. A man has only so much time in his life, so if you can understand one are well then you can make a difference in that&nbsp;area. </p>
<p>Then he began giving his money away. He created foundations, libraries, trusts.  He ended up giving away 90% of his money before he&nbsp;died.</p>
<p>He tried to prevent world war 1 and was deeply troubled that it hadn’t been&nbsp;prevented.</p>
<p>He ended up being one of the richest men in the history of the world. And he set a great example of what to do with that&nbsp;wealth.</p>
