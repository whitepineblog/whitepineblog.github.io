          <section class="content"><p>Wow, what a life. He changed how we understand the world.  And it wasn’t just one paper. He produced new ideas repeatedly.  How did he do&nbsp;it?</p>
<p><span class="more"></span>
The author said he started asking the question at 16, what it would look like if you were traveling on a beam of light. Everyone knows he created the theory of relativity but he did much more&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>Look at his wikipedia page and the list under the scientific career. It is long and exciting.  Not only did he produce great work at the beginning of his career but he continued to&nbsp;contribute.</p>
<p>I love reading a book and seeing how it is that a human being can discover or create something that didn’t&nbsp;exist.</p>
<p>The ability to view the world, to wonder, to ask questions and then to answer those questions in a way that changes how others view the world. That is powerful and&nbsp;amazing.</p>
<p>He had to put in the work and the effort.  And it paid&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>Einstein was disgusted with the militarism of Germany and despised the Nazi’s.  He gave up his pacifism to urge fighting&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I found it interesting that he admired&nbsp;Spinoza.  </p>
<p>He seemed like a man who loved life and lived it&nbsp;well.  </p>
