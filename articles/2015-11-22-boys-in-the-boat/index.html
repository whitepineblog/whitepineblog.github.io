<p>Joe certainly didn’t have it easy. His mother dying, his new step mom convincing his dad to leave Joe behind when they moved during the Great&nbsp;Depression.</p>
<p>He worked hard, made it into <span class="caps">UW</span> and on the crew team.  What a story he and the other boys created. They worked hard in school and on the boat. Their coach Al was impressed and there was a rivalry between Washington and California.  California had gone to the 28 and 32&nbsp;Olympics.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">UW</span> team won some tough races and made it to the Olympics. Their they won gold by a quarter of a second.  What a race it was rowing faster then they have ever rowed&nbsp;before. </p>
