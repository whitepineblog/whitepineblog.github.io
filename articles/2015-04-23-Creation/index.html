<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Life’s code has an alphabet of 4 characters.  These 4 characters are the recipes for creating 20 amino acids.  The 20 amino acids are used to create proteins and are essential to life here on&nbsp;Earth.</p>
<p>Where did the recipe come from?  Scientists looking back into the evidence of the history of the Earth are missing a lot of evidence due to the early bombardment in the solar system.  Did life arise multiple times only to be wiped out by massive asteroids?  Its possible.  Was the precursor to <span class="caps">DNA</span> RNA?  Also possible.  Apparently cosmic dust is full of organic molecules.  Darwin supposed life began in a warm primordial pool and his idea  might not be that far off from the truth. Or was Earth seeded with life from&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thanks to many years of hard scientific and technological advancement genomes can be sequence, created and altered.  The entire <span class="caps">DNA</span> of a bacteria has been created and then placed inside a cell and it worked.  There is work going on in creating a new type of DNA using different molecules. Synthetic biology is happening already.  Just a few days ago several Chinese scientists published a paper about editing the genome in a human&nbsp;embryo.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DNA</span> can carry code and can be used to store information today.  And it lasts for a long time.  We can still recover data from long dead mammoths. Maybe one day we will be storing archived data in DNA&nbsp;chips.</p>
<p>Evolution has provided the language of life and humans are going to use it, change it and optimize for their&nbsp;use.</p>
