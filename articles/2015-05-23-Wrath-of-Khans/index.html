<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Ghenghis Khan united the tribes on the steps. Then he conquered more land and more nations then any other person before&nbsp;him.  </p>
<p>His army was spectacular the mobility, the strength and the strategy surpassed those they fought against.  China, Russia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East were all devastated by the Mongol&nbsp;forces.  </p>
<p>The expeditionary force that defeated the Russians and surprised them was thought by the Europeans to be some sort of act of God.  When the mongols returned in full force an attacked Hungaria the only thing that saved Europe was the death of the Khan.  The Mamuluks were able to beat them back and saved egypt.  Then infighting among the Mongols prevented further&nbsp;expansion.</p>
<p>The brutality of human beings to other human beings is shocking.  Death, torture, rape and pillaging seem to fill our history books. I think we can do&nbsp;better. </p>
