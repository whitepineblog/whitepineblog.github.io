John Mauchly, Presper Eckert created the ENIAC for the military and launched electronic computing.


Mechanical computers were in use.  They were slow and unreliable. With world war 2 on the tables for artillery were desperately needed.

Eckert and Mauchly came up with the proposal to build a pure electrical machine.  1000 times faster then other mechanical ones.

18,000 Vacuum tubes.

Base 10, timer circuit, parallel computation model.

Univac

Princeton 

Patent fights

Launching their own company, bankruptcy, IBM and others coming along and then lawsuits.

Loss of recognition.  Von Neumann architecture instead of Eckert Architecture.
