The conference at Yalta, the fire bombing of Dresden, Hitler falls and what takes his place.

Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt at a table discussing and hammering out plans for the UN, for Germany, for the fate of Poland, Europe and the rest of the world.

A story of one battle then another.  It amazes me how the Germans continued to fight for Hitler even after it was clear that there was no hope in the war. They destroyed their own bridges, factories and country as they retreated from the Americans and the Russians.

The Russians had a viscous reputation of rape and brutality as they came in, wrecking vengeance for the Germans invasion of their land before.

Hitler's health deteriorated along with his army. Himmler was secretly working with a Jewish organization in Switzerland, trying to barter lives for a peace agreement.
