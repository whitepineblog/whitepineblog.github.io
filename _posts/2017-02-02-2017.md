Jack London certainly lived an adventurous life.  He grew up in the bay area, became an oyster pirate, sailed to Japan for a seal hunt, worked back braking manual labor. He went to Alaska found no gold, but found the inspiration for some of his best stories.

He would write every day. Some stories and books much better then others. Upon acheiving success he mismanaged his money and was constantly in debt and under the stress of needing to make more money. He had affairs with 2 different women while married to his first wife, married the second woman. He had a sailing boat built called the Snark and sailed west to Hawaii, then Tahiti with the goal of going entirely around the world.

He created some amazing works. The man worked hard and played hard. He had a ranch up north near Petaluma where he died at the age of 42, born in 1876, dying in 1916.
