Thucydedes saw it happen to the greek city states of Athens and Sparta, the rising power ended up fighting a war that caused destruction on both sides that neither really wanted.

Germany challenging Britian, Japan challenging china and the US, now China challenging the US status quote. War can be avoided but it will take a long term strategy and understanding of eachother that seems to be lacking on both sides.

The future is going to be full of suprising twists and turns I am sure, just as the past is now.
