Almost 2000 years ago the emperor of the Roman empire wrote down his notes about his life.  Short sayings and ideas about how to live and what he had learned.


It is still interesting to read today. He followed the Stoic philosophy. A focus on doing your duty and your best, remembering that death comes to all and you don't know when so value and use the moment wisely.

>"You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant."

>"Don't wast the rest of your time worrying about other people-unless it affects the common good. You will be to preoccupied with what so and so is doing, and why, and what they're saying, and what they're thinking ... and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind"

>"Even if you're going to live three thousand more years, or ten time that, remember you cannot lose another life than the one you're living now, or live another one then the one you're losing.  The longest amounts to the shortest. The present is the same for everyone its loss is the same for everyone and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can't lose either the past or the future. How could you lose what you don't have."
