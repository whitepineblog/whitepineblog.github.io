From the pyramids to Martin Luther and many people in between Durant paints a fascinating picture of humans and their interactions with each other.

The stories from ancient Greece, Rome and of others captured the reality of life in the era.  These people had their hopes and dreams, then lived and died.  Some accomplished a lot, it was amazing to see what some of these people had accomplished in their lives.

Pericles who held power for more then 30 years and created a marvelous peace.  It was interesting to read his wife Aspasia was a prostitute.  And then the rise of philosophy. These long dead people are still influencing thought in our world today.

Rome sure had interesting time of it. Good rulers and bad, from republic to empire.

Reading of Raphael and Michelangelo and their creations. Leonardo Da Vinci the epitome of the Renaissance. 

The reformation was quite the event.  Individuals are powerful and can change the course of history in unexpected ways. I wonder what the short history of civilization will focus on 5,000 years from now. What sort of mention will my era get?
