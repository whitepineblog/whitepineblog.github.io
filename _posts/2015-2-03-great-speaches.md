Socrates, "Now it is time that we were going, I to die and you to live, but which of us has the happier prospect is unknown to anyone but God."

The speeches begin with Socrates and are short excerpts but I certainly enjoyed stepping back in time to listen to Edmund Burke, Patrick Henry, Abraham Lincoln and others.

Demosthenes was angry and at the man who supported the conqueror of Greece, Cicero was angry and the man who he felt was betraying Rome, William of Normandy was mad at King Harold.

Lots of mad people it was an interesting listen though.  I enjoyed Edmund Burke speaking out for American rights and what would happen if they were ignored.  I wonder if Britain had acted more responsibly what would America be today?

It was nice to be exposed to the speech against slavery and the speech from the French Revolution, then ending with the call for womens suffrage.

Styles of speech have changed but the speech of one person, the sharing of their ideas and passions continues to have an effect on people.  I wonder today that the art of speeches and their effect has lessened. 

People do read blog posts though. :)
