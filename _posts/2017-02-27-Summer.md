I want to go backpacking again, walking up over high mountain passes, jumping into snow melt lakes, laying back and looking at the milky way and watching shooting stars.

So many good memories in the wonderful wild, listening to John Muir's writings of places I have been 100 some years after him they are still just as majestic.  Tenaya peak, half dome, clouds rest, the Tuolumne meadows the grand granite walls, the soft verdant meadows, the rushing falls, he describes it all very well.  

2 weeks ago I was biking down the coastal trail from pantoll and experience one of those breathtaking sunrises I had to stop and just watch it happend.  The clouds turned from a dark blue into a brilliant orange yellow light spreading across the skies and as I came down the trail the lighting across the grass and bushes made everything seem more real, it brought back the memories of hundreds of other sunrises I have experienced before, each unique, but each breathing the same life into a new day making me feel alive.

The Sierra's did that for John Muir and the wilderness does the same for me!
