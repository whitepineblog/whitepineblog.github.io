My Lai Massacre, Kissinger, THe Iraq war, WMD, corruption coverups and bringing transparency to the American people. Quite a career, quite a life. I hope we can end up with more reporter like him working hard to find the story and bring it out.

He worked for the NY times for a while, wrote some extensive books, and has worked to expose when governments are lying to their people.
