I liked it.  The talk of how the brain creates consciousness.  The ability to calm the mind and examine yourself.  More focus, patience, compassion.


Some of my favorite quotes, snippets and ideas:

Your mind determines the quality of your life.

Love, gratitude devotion and compassion.

Unified Perceptions.

Consciousness is the context in which the objects of experience appear.

Build your own telescope.

Every moment offers an opportunity to relax  to decided to respond or suffer unnecessarily

Consciously practice gratitude.  You can learn not to stay angry.

The sense that we are unified subjects is a fiction.

The goal of meditation is to uncover a form of well being that is inherent to the nature of our minds.

Meditation doesn't entail suppression of thoughts but it requires that we notice thoughts as they emerge and recognize them to be transitory appearances in consciousness. 

I donâ€™t have to believe in a higher power or being to benefit from meditation and training my mind.
