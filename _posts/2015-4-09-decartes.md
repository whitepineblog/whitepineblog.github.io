What can you really trust. Your senses can be deceived. Reason can be distilled down and all paradoxes discovered and addressed.

When dreaming your mind can be fooled to thinking you are awake and any absurd or strange thing you experience feels real to your mind. Even if it doesn't make sense.

Descartes if famous for saying I think therefore I am. For his philosophy he wanted to establish what you can really trust.  Can you trust your senses?  He says no.  Take for example dreaming.  When in a dream you often think it is real and your senses say to your mind it is.  Likewise when awake your senses can be deceived.  

Reason or mine own thoughts can be examined.  If there is something incorrect in them eventually I can find the inconsistencies or the paradoxes.  From the establishment of reason and the ability to think as a base Descartes goes on to say that God must exist because a creator or a first thinker is required.

He was quite the individual, very prolific in his life.  Creating, researching, thinking questioning.
