A victorian man of the empire who lived to watch the victorian era end and the empire with it. He fought in Pakistan, India, Cuba, lost his bid for election then became a correspondant in South Africa, was captured then released and became famous and then won his spot in parliment.  The Dardenelles plan failed but maybe not because of him, maybe because of the lack of support. He was forced to leave government took up painting for a bit but found his way back into the war. 

Even living in the trenches, with the troops, he took terrible risks flying to and from the front. Winston was a man full of confidence and grit, also extremely lucky he wasn't killed in an amazing number of close calls. 

His mother Jenny was American, his father was Lord Randolph who's career was cut short by his own mistakes. After winning world war one he wanted to send food and supplies to the Germans so they wouldn't starve. Magnominus in Victory. He was over ruled.
