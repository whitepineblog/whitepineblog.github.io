War is always brutal, although the number of dead pales in comparison to modern wars the revolutionary war was still full of death and bravery, as well as stupidity and genius.

The book is an fast paced telling of many of the major battles, the hardships, the strategies and the outcome of the war. It was hard. Men had to march for thousands of miles ford rivers and creeks many times, supplies were often low or rancid, clothers worn out or non-existant. It is amazing the colonials were able to pull it off.  Nathaniels Green's brilliant retreat throught the south, Cornwallis unwilling to give up the chase.

Luckily the french got involved pulling british troops elswhere and the french fleet was able to help lock in Cornwallis and win the day.  Years of deprivation and fighting, many men who fought for the revolution were bankrupted and ended up dying penniless.  Some were able to recieve pensions for themselves or eventually for their widows or orphans. It was not an easy fight.
