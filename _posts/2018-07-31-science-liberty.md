Liberal democracies were caused by the scientific revolution, people began to question the world around them and the authority around them.

"If human knowledge is based on our interactions with a materila world that obeys natural laws, it follow that natural law i s the proper basis for human government. It was through this line of reasoning that Locke identified natural rights such as livery which he defined as 'the poer a man has to do or forbear doing any parcitular action according as he himself wills it.' Liberty is rooted in human learning, since people can educate themselves, and act on what they have learned only insofar as they are free"

Science cannot flourish in an autocratic society, see the brain drain of the Nazis. The Soviets top down approach led to many missed areas and isolation of their scientists to foriegn ideas led them to fall behind in many areas.

Post modernisms attack on science by saying it is all subjective denies reality and courts authoritarinism when it blocks the discussion of ideas it doesn't agree with and says to ignore the evidence.

"Scientist's have a story of discovery to tell, dogmatists a story of obedience to authority"
