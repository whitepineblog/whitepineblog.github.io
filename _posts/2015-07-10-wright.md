Bicycle mechanics that changed the world.

The Wright brothers surprised everyone with their ability to control their plane and to keep it in the air. Shortly before their public flights the director of the Smithsonian's attempt at flight crashed into the river and after spending tens of thousands of tax payer dollars there was no working plane.

The Wright brothers used their own modest profits from their bike shop to pay for materials and trips to Kitty Hawk where over years they refined their designs. It was certainly not easy work. One year they were made miserable by mosquitoes another the wind destroyed their flier. It was hard work and required modification of the craft and.

The big demo in Europe silenced all naysayers, that Wilbur was able to fly and turn amazed the crowds. He was able to fly longer, higher and further then any human had before.  Shortly after Orville wowed the crowds in Washington, his flights ended in a crash with serious injuries and the death of the military man who was the passenger. But not before people realized the Wright brothers had surpassed anyone else and were truly the first to bring flight to the human race.

They were made modestly rich by their contracts, Wilbur died first, then their beloved sister Catherine, and eventually Orville.
