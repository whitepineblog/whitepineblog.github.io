You should read Isaac's favorite short story "The Last Question". It is included at the end of the book. I remember reading it some years ago as a teenager and reading it again brought back the same feelings again.

I am always impressed by his prolific writing, so many books. I enjoyed reading the auto biographical sections and came away inspired and impressed with all that he accomplished.

A quote from Alfred Noyes in the book: "Fools have said that knowledge drives out wonder from the world; they'll say it still, though all the dust's ablaze with miracles at their feet."

"I believe in the scientific method and the rule of reason as a way of understanding the natural universe. I don't believe in the existence of entities that cannot be reached by suach a method."

I loved the story of him vistin Mr Campbell and the encouragement that came from Campbell to write, even with the rejection letters.

I want to get his commentary on shakespear, and maybe a few other books. I certainly do enjoy his style of simple conversational writing.
