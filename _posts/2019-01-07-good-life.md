You should read Isaac's favorite short story "The Last Question". It is included at the end of the book. I remember reading it some years ago as a teenager and reading it again brought back the same feelings again.

I am always impressed by his prolific writing, so many books. I enjoyed reading the auto biographical sections and came away inspired and impressed with all that he accomplished.
