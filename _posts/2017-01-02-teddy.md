What would it be like to have a real conservationist in the white house again. I am grateful for people like Teddy who fought
for our land and worked so hard to help preserve it. What a fascinating life he lived from rich family to the forests of Maine
to the badlands, the rockies, creating the rough riders, becoming president, running the river of doubt and all the adventures
in between. Pathological enthusiasm indeed.
