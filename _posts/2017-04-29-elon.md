I read this book while driving to and from yosemite. Wow it was inspiring, the man sets goals that almost no one else would even dream of thinking of accomplishing and then he goes out and does it! Almost failing but overcoming and then not resting but gunning for more, colonizing mars, solving the dirty energy problem here on earth. The man deserves some rest after all this and the people who have worked with him to accomplish it.  I am in awe of what he has done and cheer him on, and I think he has a good chance of succeeding!
