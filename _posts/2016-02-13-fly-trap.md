Intertwining his own story about the study of hover flies with the story of Malaise
created a beautiful book. I came away feeling like I had read some great insights
about living a life. What I did read was a good story.

A story of the love of hover flies, or more accurately the study of hover flies.
His description of how one can learn to read nature like learning to read a language.
Knowing the species of plants, animals their activities gives you a deeper
glimpse then just walking through it all.

What a life Malaise lived journeying to Russia, Japan, Burma his marriages and
then his fascination with atlantis and then becoming a collector of paintings.

One of which the author became an owner.

What an enjoyable book!
