Capitalism vs The Environment

Will we work to save the planet? Some progress has been made but we are losing the battle.

Humans continue to pump out climate changing gases that are going to alter our climate dramatically. This is a threat to our way of life but it seems that humans aren't taking it seriously.

There is hope, but we have wasted the last decade. Lets work together and keep fossil fuels in the ground and switch to renewable resources that won't destroy our world.  Some countries have made remarkable progress, others not so much.
