Understanding the world around you. Asking useful questions. Being an intelligent human being. Some of the concepts you can find in this collection of short works.

Helped create the atomic bomb, rubbed shoulders with some of the brightest men of his age, received the Nobel Prize for some of his works, but my favorite part were the stories about his dad.

His dad made uniforms for a living, but through his long walks in the woods and asking his sun to explain and understand how things really work he exposed him to the ideas of science.

What an interesting life Feynman lived.  His first wife died of TB while he was at Los Alamos, he learned to pick locks and he loved to talk Physics with anyone.  

He wonders at the importance of clubs, and why would you want to be a member of a club that spends most it's time deciding who gets to be in the club.

He spoke of pseudo science and the differences between real science. I enjoyed his speech on how we can miniaturize information, motors, machines and what that would look like.  Very visionary.

Do we live in a scientific world when every newspaper still prints a horoscope section? 

It is important that we test statements and ideas and pronouncements with useful tests, involving control groups and recreating tests to see if we get the same data.
