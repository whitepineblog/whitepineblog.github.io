Alexander Humboldt.  A name that not to many people currently remember but we should. He was one of the first to unite scientific examination with poetic prose creating the works Views of Nature, Personal Narritive and many others that have had a profound effect on our current society.  These works inspired Darwin, Marshe, Thoreau, John Muir and countless others.

Born in prussia into wealth after his over protective mother passed away he went on his fist expedition to the America's. Turned out to be quite the trip, he hiked the Andes went to as many Volcanoes as he could, explored rivers was attacked by misquitos met new tribes, explored new lands and found countless numbers of unknown species.
