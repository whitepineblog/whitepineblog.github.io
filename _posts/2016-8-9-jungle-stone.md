Stephens and Catherwood. Explorers who were the first to reveal the true breadth
and majesty of the ancient Mayan cities. And what an adventure it was like the
explorations of Humboult, Louis and Clark and others they went into the unknown.
Catherwood was an amazing artist, Stephens a gifted writer.  They both traveled
in Europe. Stephens wrote a best seller about his adventures there. Catherwood
created amazing paintings and even setup panoramas to display his work. They met
in New York.

Stephens got an appointment to visit the Republic in Central America that was in
the process of disintegrating, they left to Guatemala floated up rivers hacked
through jungles, survived bandits and musquitos and were able to return with
quite the story to tell.  Their book became an instant best seller. They went
back one more time.

Stephens ended up back working to build a railroad where he died. Catherwood
ended up dying during the sinking of the boat the Artic in the Atlantic ocean.

This was quite the amazing book.  I would love to have copies of their original
works.
