Attanasof lived an interesting life from creating machines to measure the
seismic waves of the bikini atoll bomb testing to creating a computer with an in
program memory.

The book told some of the story of other pioneers, Alan Turing, Konrad Zuse and
others.

The creators of the Eniac, Eckert, Mauchly and Neumann. And the controversial
court ruling that Attanasof's creation was proof of prior art preventing 20 years
of stifling innovation.

It is amazing what human beings can create
