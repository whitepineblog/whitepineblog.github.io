From Sequim to Berlin the story of some humans winning a race.

Joe certainly didn't have it easy. His mother dying, his new step mom convincing his dad to leave Joe behind when they moved during the Great Depression.

He worked hard, made it into UW and on the crew team.  What a story he and the other boys created. They worked hard in school and on the boat. Their coach Al was impressed and there was a rivalry between Washington and California.  California had gone to the 28 and 32 Olympics.

The UW team won some tough races and made it to the Olympics. Their they won gold by a quarter of a second.  What a race it was rowing faster then they have ever rowed before.
