Brain damage, it can reveal how the brain works.

Thread or processes of thought. We have constant streams of information coming into our brain.  How do we filter out what we want to pay attention to?

And how do we process the audio and visual inputs to come to an understanding of what is around us?

How do we decide what to do?

The author suffered a concussion and for 8 years struggled with brain damage that effected every aspect of his life.  He kept notes about it.  No one could help him until he found doctor Zelinksy who had special glasses that helped retrain the brain.

Fascinating book.
