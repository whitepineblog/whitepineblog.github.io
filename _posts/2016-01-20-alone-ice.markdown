Shackleton, Scott the great arctice exploreres but one of the most accomplished explorers was Dawson
of the AAE who established 2 bases wintered over and had 8 expeditions out exploringing.

His party met with a terrible accident Nimitz dying with all their supplies down a crevice, the second dying on their way back
and Dawson arriving 5 hours after the boat left so he and the others had to wait another winter for rescue.

Fascinating tale of survival, strength and perserverence.
