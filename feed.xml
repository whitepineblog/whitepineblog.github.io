      <description>&lt;p&gt;I discovered a fantastic book a few weeks ago.  I was browsing the library in the topic of history and found Will Durants, Story of Philosophy.  I thought it might be boring but I would give it a try. I am glad I did.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has been entertaing, educating and a great glimpse into the minds of some interesting humans. I was suprised to find out, after I had listend to half of it, that the book was published in the year 1926.  The Story of Philosophy became a best seller and then he and his wife then went on to write their huge work the Story of Civilization at nearly 10,000 pages. Sadly even at that length it was unfished due them dieing of old age in the 1980’s. They only made it to the age of Napoleon. Turns out the author himself was a rather fascinating person. You should definetly checkout his &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Durant&quot;&gt;wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways back to his book. It is a quick survey of people who have influenced and created philosophy. I loved the historical bits.  In fact I think I enjoyed learning more about the philosphers lives then about the philosphers philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started of course with Socrates.  The man who was influencing a younger generation of people to ruin and was then condemned to death for his questions.  He loved to answer questions with more questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then his pupal Plato. This is the first time I have actually listened to Plato’s Republic. I had checked it out of the library years ago but never got past the introduction. I enjoyed listening to the ideas for a perfect society and a perfect rule of law.  The idea of leaders who over decades had been weeded out from the masses down to the smartest and the best before they were given the chance to rule and decide the fate of a nation seems like a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then on to Aristotle.  Apparently the man got a lot of things wrong.  For example he held to the idea that women had less teeth and less ribs and that the planet was the center of the Universe even though Thales, Anaxagores and others had proposed that the Sun was at the center and the earth revolved around it.  Aristotle spent alot of time catalouging learning and helped the beginings of science, or maybe he held back science for so long because people trusted him so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francis Bacon, the politician philospher.  He spent his adult life furthering the rule of England and in his spare time creating and writing philosophies that would sound through the ages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Spinoza, the excommunicated jew who almost no one knew changed the foundation of philosphy until his work was published posthumously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltaire, -  Let me just say you should get and read or listen to the book just for this chapter. What an interesting person.  I went to the library and got an entire book to read about him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on, Kant, SchopenHauer, Herbet Spenver, Nietzsche, European philosophers, American philosphers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first book on philosophy I think I am actually going to finish. 88 Years after he published it Mr Durants book is still introducing some philosophy to people like me. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spirituality Without Religion by Sam Harris</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I liked it.  The talk of how the brain creates consciousness.  The ability to calm the mind and examine yourself.  More focus, patience, compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite quotes, snippets and ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;Br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mind determines the quality of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, gratitude devotion and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified Perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is the context in which the objects of experience appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build your own telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every moment offers an opportunity to relax  to decided to respond or suffer unnecessarily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consciously practice gratitude.  You can learn not to stay angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sense that we are unified subjects is a fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of meditation is to uncover a form of well being that is inherent to the nature of our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation doesn’t entail suppression of thoughts but it requires that we notice thoughts as they emerge and recognize them to be transitory appearances in consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have to believe in a higher power or being to benefit from meditation and training my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Zero to One by Peter Thiel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like reading these optimistic books. They get me fired up about the world and all the opportunities that exist out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorites snippets and ideas:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monopoly, when you create and deliver something no other business does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary tech must be at least ten times better then its substitute to lead to a real advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small minorities often achieve disproportionate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not a portfolio.  Individuals cannot diversify their own life by keeping dozens of careers in reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools do it wrong.  homogenized generic knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does matter what you do.  You should focus relentlessly on something your good at doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it be valuable in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a power law world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something hard to do but doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual truth is there are many more secrets left to find but they will yield only to the relentless searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two kinds of secrets, secrets of nature and secrets about people.&lt;/p&gt;
